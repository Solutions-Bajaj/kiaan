A lightweight, embeddable voice assistant widget that can be added to any website. The Kiaan assistant provides an interactive, AI-powered voice and chat interface through a draggable orb that floats on your website.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository or download the `kiaan` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/solutions-bajaj/kiaan-widget.git
   ```

2. Copy the `kiaan` folder to your website's root directory.

3. Add the following code to your website footer (before the closing `</body>` tag):
   ```html
   <!-- Kiaan Assistant -->
   <script src="/kiaan/config.js"></script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/kiaan/kiaan-widget.css">
   <script src="/kiaan/kiaan-widget.js"></script>
   ```

That's it! The Kiaan assistant will now appear as a floating, draggable orb in the bottom-right corner of your website.
